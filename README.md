# UnitOneSummative
This is a deomnstration of knowledge for a Programming 3U class. I focused on making a user-editable graphics engine with some basic features
and then moved on to making the image the user drew interact in a scene, sort of like a choose-your-own-adventure thing. I'm not planning on
finishing the project, but I will be using the graphics code in other projects for sure. All of the code is commented so if someone wanted to
continue working on it (for some reason) it should be pretty easy to pick up where I left off.
